[![GitHub Pages](https://img.shields.io/badge/View-GitHub%20Pages-blue)](https://johnplake.github.io/ai-responsibility-lit-review/)

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive literature review surveying methods for evaluating corporations on AI responsibility—analogous to an "AI Responsibility Index."

## Research Questions

This review addresses five key research questions:

1. **Existing Frameworks**: What frameworks, indices, or rating systems currently evaluate corporate AI responsibility?
2. **Automation Approaches**: Are there NLP-based or automated pipelines to reduce human annotation costs?
3. **Source Documents**: What documents are evaluations based on (10-K filings, sustainability reports, etc.)?
4. **Key Dimensions**: What criteria and dimensions are used in these evaluations?
5. **Gaps**: What gaps exist in current approaches?

## Key Findings

### Major Indices Identified

| Index | Scope | Organization |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| AI Safety Index | 7 frontier AI labs | Future of Life Institute |
| Digital Inclusion Benchmark | 200 tech companies | World Benchmarking Alliance |
| Evident AI Index | 50 banks | Evident Insights |
| Ranking Digital Rights | 14 Big Tech platforms | WBA/Ranking Digital Rights |
| AI Company Data Initiative | 1,000+ companies | Thomson Reuters Foundation |

### Core Evaluation Dimensions

Across frameworks, these dimensions appear consistently:

- **Governance & Accountability** - Board oversight, ethics committees, policies
- **Transparency & Explainability** - Algorithm disclosure, model documentation
- **Fairness & Non-Discrimination** - Bias testing, demographic analysis
- **Safety & Security** - Risk assessment, red teaming, incident response
- **Privacy & Data Governance** - Data minimization, user rights
- **Human Oversight** - Human-in-the-loop, override capability
- **Environmental Sustainability** - Energy consumption, carbon footprint

### Automation Approaches

- **FinBERT/ESG-BERT**: Domain-specific language models for financial/ESG text
- **LLM-based 10-K analysis**: Automated SEC filing analysis pipelines
- **Topic modeling**: NLP extraction of themes from policy documents
- **Model Cards**: Standardized AI model documentation
